- Viewing the photos
There are no programs to install to view the poses. We provide the photos in the most widely used standard format--JPG. This makes it easy to view and print the photos using your favorite software. Most operating systems also provide a way to view JPG files without any additional software. In Windows or on a Mac, double-clicking a photo will display it in the default viewer.

If you prefer a more sophisticated viewer, there are many choices for download from the internet. On a PC, IrfanView is free and efficient. On a Mac, iPhoto is an option.

- Viewing the pose in 360-degree rotation
A simple way to view a pose in rotation is by opening one of the files in your preferred viewer and using the forward and back buttons. Some programs have a slideshow feature, sometimes with options like looping and variable delay between photos.

Our policy for use of the photos is:
The photos may be used as a reference for creating traditional art which may then be sold. For example, a drawing, painting, or sculpture is permissible under these guidelines whereas a work which uses the actual photos, such as a collage, would be prohibited. The photos may be used for games, videos, and digital art if first manipulated in a substantive way, for example, as the basis for a wireframe mesh, skin, or texture. However, they may NOT, in whole or in part, be resold, repackaged and sold, nor given away.
